PyAnsys Shared Components
=========================

To enable the use of Ansys products through Python, shared components
have been created. These shared components are not interfaces to
specific products nor single-purpose tools. They are libraries to
facilitate code-sharing across different PyAnsys packages within
the PyAnsys project.

These are expanding and developing libraries. Feel free
to post issues on the `Issues <https://github.com/pyansys/pyansys-library-docs/issues>_`
page. For additional support, contact `PyAnsys Support
<mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_, asking team members to
route your requests to the appropriate development teams.
