PyAnsys Shared Components
=========================

As part of the PyAnsys project to enable the usage of Ansys
products through Python, we have created shared components
that are reusable across the different packages.

These shared components are not interfaces to specific products nor
single-purpose tools. They are libraries to facilitate code-sharing
within the PyAnsys project.

These are expanding and developing libraries. Feel free
to post issues on the various GitHub pages referenced at the
end of this document. For additional support, contact `PyAnsys Support
<mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_, who will correctly route
your requests to the appropriate development teams.
