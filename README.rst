PyAnsys Shared Components
=========================

As part of the PyAnsys project to enable the usage of Ansys
products through Python we have created shared components
that we intend to be reusable across the different packages.

These are not interfaces to specific products, nor single-purpose
tools, but libraries to facilitate code-sharing within the project.

This is an expanding and developing project. Feel free
to post issues on the various GitHub pages in this document.
For additional support, contact the `PyAnsys Support
<mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_ and your requests will be
routed correctly.
