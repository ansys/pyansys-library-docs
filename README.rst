PyAnsys Shared Components
=========================

As part of the PyAnsys project to enable the usage of Ansys
products through Python we have created shared components
that we intend to be reusable across the different packages.

These are not interfaces to specific products, nor single-purpose
tools, but libraries to facilitate code-sharing within the project.

This is an expanding and developing project. Feel free
to post issues on the various GitHub pages in this document.
For additional support, contact the `PyAnsys Support
<mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_ and your requests will be
routed correctly.

OpenAPI-Common
--------------
The ``openapi-common`` repository provides the source code for authentication-aware
client for OpenAPI client libraries.

The PyAnsys OpenAPI Common library is intended for use with the custom code generation
template in the `PyAnsys project <https://github.com/pyansys>`_. This library currently
supports authentication with Basic, Negotiate, NTLM, and OpenID Connect. Most features
of the underlying requests session are exposed for use. Some basic configuration is also
provided by default.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ``openapi-common`` with:

.. code::

   pip install ansys-openapi-common

Usage
~~~~~
The package exposes several classes, including a client :py:class:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClient` and a
builder :py:class:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory`, these allow a client
library to configure a connection to an API.

The :py:class:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClient` class is intended to be wrapped by code that implements 
a client library.

Authentication is configured through the :py:class:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory`
object and its :py:meth:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory.with_credentials`,
:py:meth:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory.with_autologon`, and 
:py:meth:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory.with_oidc` methods. If no authentication 
is required, you can use the :py:meth:`~ansys.openapi.common.ApiClientFactory.with_anonymous` method.
You can provide additional configuration with the :py:class:`~ansys.openapi.common.SessionConfiguration` object.

.. code:: python

   >>> from ansys.openapi.common import ApiClientFactory
   >>> session = ApiClientFactory('https://my-api.com/v1.svc')
   ...           .with_autologon()
   ...           .connect()
   <ApiClient url: https://my-api.com/v1.svc>
