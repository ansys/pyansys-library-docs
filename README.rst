PyAnsys Shared Components
=========================

To enable the use of Ansys products through Python, shared components
have been created. These shared components are not interfaces to
specific products nor single-purpose tools. They are libraries to
facilitate code-sharing across different PyAnsys packages within
the PyAnsys project.

As shared components continue to be developed and created, feel free
to post issues on the **Issues** pages for their respective
GitHub repositories. For additional support, contact
`PyAnsys Support <mailto:pyansys.support@ansys.com>`_ so that
team members can route your requests to appropriate development teams.
